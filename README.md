# Python-Postgres game matching app

Simple project in Python and Postgres

## Check Environment

```bash
which python
psql --version
```

should show a proper python path, and version of Postgres

## How it works

1. It implements tournament between players.
2. It matches players using Swiss pairing.

## Example

```bash
cd /where/your/project/root/is
python tournament_test.py
```

Yay, no error!
